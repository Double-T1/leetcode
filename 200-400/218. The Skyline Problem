//there are mainly three solutions
// 1 is through bruten force, which requires O(n^2) time
// 2 is through sweep line, sequentially updating the maximum height O(nlogn)
// 3 is through dvide and conquer =, gradually eliminate overlapping heights O(nlogn)

//will not demonstrate solution 1, since it is TLE

//solution 2 sweep line
//conventioanlly sweep line preserve an array with the length that covers the width of the input elements, then we sweep through them
//it would work in this case if the width are < 10^8, since we need O(n) traversing it.
//unfortunately, the maximum width is 2^31-1, which is approximately 2.14*10^9.

//Thus, we could only traverse the elements themselves
//we need a DS to dynaimcally update height, get maximum height and delete height in acceptable time
//plausible dataset: indexed prriority queue, multiset, multimap (we need a multi- since there might be recurring widths)
//we use multiset in this case since it is provided by c++ as a standard container
//time: O(nlogn)
