/**
constraint: O(n) or O(nlogn)
1. length is even
2. i !== i+1 with i=2n


brute force: check whether each ele should be deleted
=> greedy: if the current i fulfill, don't bother, only delete if necessary
the question: if not fulfilled, should we delete i or i+1?? => doesn't matter, since i===i+1 in this case

minimum deletion
